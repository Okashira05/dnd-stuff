Playing as an astral elf has been a joy and a pain, since there is no information on them besides for the play test material. So I have taken it upon myself to not only expand their background but personalize their racial traits. I hope you enjoy this new content. 
Side note: These elves are a seperate race... Unlike the other elves, astral elves have not only gone through a physical transformation, but also a divine transformation which I believe would have effected their fey blood. Mixing into something other than just fey. So elf yes, subrace no.

Aurora is one of the best 5e Character Builders I have found. If any one is looking for an upgrade to your DnD campaign this is the tool for you.

Here are the links to get your started! Thank you so much for creating this wonderful program!
